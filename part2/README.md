Here is the key to the column headers in the dataset. 

* Morphology_R - morphological parse, romanization. Consists of more or less the URs for each morpheme
* Morphology_H - morphological parse, Hangul.
* Production_R - production, romanization. Represents the option chosen by the participant, in phonetic detail (ie, representing the actual assumed segmental targets, the "SR", with phonological processes applied)
* Production_H - production, Hangul.
* UR - segmental sequence surrounding the morpheme juncture (noted "-")
* SR - segmental sequence of how the UR was produced in the Production
* simplify_delete_obstruent - did the speaker delete an obstruent in the UR? (1 = yes, 0 = no, NA = not applicable)
* simplify_delete_lateral - did the speaker delete a lateral in the UR? 
* nasalize - did the speaker nasalize the coda of the stem? Nasal assimilation is regressive across the morpheme boundary from the suffix, targeting an obstruent. 
* lateralize - did the speaker lateralize the onset of the affix? In l-final stems, lateralization is progressive across the morpheme boundary. This is rare in this dataset, but can arise if the speaker simplifies an lC cluster by deleting the obstruent, which may then feed lateralization of a following C.
* tensify	- did the speaker tensify the onset of the affix?
* Type - type of juncture.
